Each player is fully responsible for their actions, decisions, and agreements made within the game. Administration will not intervene in disputes related to these practices, except in cases where clear and significant harm to server stability or order is detected. It's important to remember that red skull situations may be sanctioned if multiclient use or other prohibited practices are detected. Extreme situations causing imbalance or disorder on the server will be analyzed individually and appropriate measures will be applied if necessary. Players are encouraged to resolve such conflicts amicably and with good behavior."
